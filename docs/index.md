# Blokboy gaming device

This project is a modern twist on the classic game called Snake, built with an ESP32 microcontroller and an display. Players control the snake using a joystick, while their movement data and scores are automatically sent to a server via WiFi.

The web interface displays a scoreboard, showing player IDs and scores in a clean, responsive design. A dedicated debug button allows real-time communication with the ESP32 for testing or troubleshooting. All data is handled through PHP scripts and stored in a database, creating a smooth and connected gaming experience.
