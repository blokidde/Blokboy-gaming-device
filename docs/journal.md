## feedback per week

## week 2

### things i learned this week
this week i learned how to 3d design and make a print. i made my own design for my handheld gaming device and we had a class about 3d printing where we needed to design and print a dice. before we could print it we had to initialize the settings for the 3d printer. this was done with a paper sheet and the springs underneath the 3d printer.
in my first try the dice was a succes, but there were some things i could inprove, like where i needed to put circles in combination with edges.

# ## feedback
feedback from ian: 

use more comments and a question about values's

feedback from peter:

code is good, nothing to say about code

feedback from nino:

code looks good, you could use more comments to make the code a bit easier to understand.

### what to change to be better?
i need to start using comments. at first i thought i would write the code first and add comments later but i noticed this makes it more difficult for myself and for readability for others. so in the class free week i will be adding comments to all my code and get everything updated for better readability.

## week 3

### things i learned this week
this week i did a workshop about lasercutting, i learned what to do with several different speeds, strengths and intervals. i also learned about the safety measures. after the workshop we had the time to make something ourselves and with the other classmates who were doing the workshop i created a design with several round curves and an infill in the design. by using the already given variables the design had a very clean cut.

in week 2 i started with the backend of my website, i created a GET.php file to get information from the database. i also created an INSERT. this is used to put stuff into the database. creating this was rather difficult because i had never really worked with php and SQL before. this meant i had to start from scratch. luckily the internet is a big help with this.

## week 4

### HTML
this week i learned more about web development. HTML helped me build the basic structure of the page. I used different tags to organize my content and added important elements like a button and a table that shows the scores that are fethced from my database scores. I also learned how to connect an external JavaScript file and a CSS file in the head section. 

### CSS
with CSS i can control how the page looks. I set up fonts, changed background colors, and made sure that different parts of the page have the right spacing. I also tried to make sure the page is responsive, so it looks good on both big screens and small screens.

### JavaScript
JavaScript made the page interactive. For example, I used the fetch function to get data from my database, then created table rows and columns to display data. I also added an event listener to the button, so that when you click it, it sends a request to the ESP32 for debugging.

### Problems
while working on web development i ran into a problem i had some difficulties solving. the css wasnt loading on the page. i needed to clear my cache everytime i wanted to check the css. by doing a little research i found out i could use something called a cache buster. after adding this

## week 5
### JavaScript
i used JavaScript to make it possible for the website to communicate with the ESP32. I used the fetch function to send a request to the ESP32's local IP address. This request asks the ESP32 to execute a command, and I logged the response in the console to check if it was working. I also learned how to handle errors if the ESP32 was not responding.

### ESP32
ESP32 as a webserver. The ESP32 runs a small server that listens for requests from my website. When the site sends a request to /command, the ESP32 processes it and sends back a response.

### 10/3/25
my goal for today is to write more in my learning journal, i also want to create a debugging function for the ESP32, so i can be able to test the sensors for my project if necessary.
