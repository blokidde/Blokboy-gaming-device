## week 1

### things i learned this week

### feedback
feedback from ian: 

use more comments and a question about values's

feedback from peter:

code is good, nothing to say about code

feedback from nino:

code looks good, you could use more comments to make the code a bit easier to understand.

### what to change to be better?
i need to start using comments. at first i thought i would write the code first and add comments later but i noticed this makes it more difficult for myself and for readability for others. so in the class free week i will be adding comments to all my code and get everything updated for better readability.

## week 2

### things i learned this week
this week i did a workshop about lasercutting, i learned what to do with several different speeds, strengths and intervals. i also learned about the safety measures. after the workshop we had the time to make something ourselves and with the other classmates who were doing the workshop i created a design with several round curves and an infill in the design. by using the already given variables the design had a very clean cut.
