# Create & Test

## test goal
the goal of this test is to check:
- if all components fit properly in the printed case
- if the joystick and buttons are comfortable to use
- if the screen is clearly visible during gameplay
- if the case feels solid and portable in the hand

these elements have the most impact on the final product because they directly influence usability, portability and durability.
