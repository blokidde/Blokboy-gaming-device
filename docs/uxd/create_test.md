# Create & Test

## test goal
the goal of this test is to check:
- if all components fit properly in the printed case
- if the joystick and buttons are comfortable to use
- if the screen is clearly visible during gameplay
- if the case feels solid and portable in the hand

these elements have the most impact on the final product because they directly influence usability, portability and durability.

## test setup
1. hold the device and comment on weight and grip
2. play a test version of the game and give feedback on controls and visibility

## test results
test subject peter
- didnt like the joystick that doest feel smooth
- the device is easy to handle and everything is in the correct place
- unclear buttons, what do they do
- takes a while for the device to start up and its unclear what the device is doing during that time
- the battery started to run out and the screen was barely visible

test subject ian
- the device fits well in the hand
- the joystick doesnt move well
- buttons are unclear

test subject koen
- the device weighs less than expected
- the display isnt level
- the joystick gets stuck sometimes
- the buttons are very unclear

## conclusion
### conclusions (based on user tests)

after running the tests with three users, the following key issues were observed:

- the joystick is not smooth and sometimes gets stuck (reported by all three users)
- the function of the buttons is unclear (reported by all users)
- the screen visibility is poor when the battery runs low (1 user) and the display is not level (1 user)
- there is no clear feedback during startup, making the device feel unresponsive (1 user)

positive feedback:
- all users said the device fits well in the hand
- the layout of the controls is logical and easy to reach
- the device is lightweight and comfortable to hold

### issues

| issue                                  | priority | reason                                                  |
|----------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| joystick is not smooth or gets stuck   | high     | affects gameplay and overall UX                    |
| button functions are unclear           | high     | creates confusion in basic interaction                  |
| screen not level / low visibility      | medium   | impacts visibility but only in some cases               |
| no startup feedback                    | medium   | affects perceived quality and responsiveness            |

## optimalization
based on the user test results, several optimisations need to be made to improve the overall usability and physical interaction of the device. these will however not me made on time for the product market.

- joystick movement improvement 
  the joystick gets stuck and does not move smoothly. the hole should be increased by 0.4 mm and the hole should have smoother edges.  

- button clarity  
  users found the button functions unclear. symbols or labels should be on or next to the buttons in the next iteration.  

- screen level adjustment
  the screen is not level with the case because of the pins, to fix this an extra hole for the pins should be made
