# Conclude & Reflect

## reflection

### general reflection
this project started with the idea of building a small handheld snake game device that looks like a gameboy. the goal was to make the casing fully 3d printable, without the use of glue or screws, and to make it feel like a polished physical product. through multiple design iterations and test prints, the device became more and more refined. the final result is a working handheld game that is portable, solid, and replicable.

working with Freecad gave me a lot of flexibility, small changes to dimensions were quick and didnâ€™t require starting over completely. 3d printing allowed me to test the physical feel and fit of components in real life, which helped improve the finalization of the design. 

### recommendations for improvements
- improve joystick fit and rotation quality using a custom joystick mount or printed bearing system
- use buttons with larger caps to improve button clarification
- add a small indicator led or animation to show when the device is booting

### failures

#### 1. joystick fit
goal: i wanted the joystick to move freely in all directions without friction  
what went wrong: i made the hole have the same dimensions as the joystick and it was way too big  
how i tried to solve it: i printed several versions with decreased hole diameter  
next time: i would test joystick tolerances with calipers first check the total movement it will need

#### 2. screen visibility
goal: i wnated to create pillars for the joysticks pcb to be attached to  
what went wrong: i created pillars for screws that were too thin   
how i tried to solve it: i made the pillars thicker
next time: i would measure the thickness of the screws i want to use first.

#### 3. first print
goal: i wanted to print my first 3d print
what went wrong: when i tried to print, the fillament didnt stick to the floormat  
how i tried to solve it: i got a teacher to calibrate the 3d printer
next time: there is unfortunately notihing that could be changed about this

#### 4. display spacing
goal: i wanted to put the display in the casing vertically
what went wrong: when i tried to put the display in, it did not fit
how i tried to solve it: i printed a new iteration with the display horizontally

#### all iterations next to eachother


### final result

the final product works as intended. all parts fit together tightly. the game can be played with the joystick and buttons, and scores are saved. the product feels solid in the hand and can be used without instructions(except for the buttons).

- the layout of all the components feels natural
- the casing is printable with common settings
- the product is replicable with all provided files and settings

the product is clean and usable. it meets the defined requirements and can be easily printed and assembled by others. it only needs a few more changes/ iterations before the product would be very good.
